#Problem-solving
**Problem statement**- As a researcher in Pharmacognosy(dealing with medicinal agents from nature), you might see a plant which you cannot identify with neither the common name or botanical name. This bottleneck has made a lot of people ignorant of the plants around their vicinity.
**Problem solving**- To solve the problem, one can create an array containing the images of all the plant plants, their leaves, flowers(if any),  stem bark, fruits etc.
Another array containing both the common name, botanical name and the picture of the plant, It's leaves, stem bark etc.
The program uses a visual identification system (maybe a camera) that allows the individual to capture images of various parts of the plant and checks the arrays containing the images of the various parts of the plants. If it finds a match it displays/logs the information contained in the other array( i.e the array containing the names of the plant, pictures etc.).
